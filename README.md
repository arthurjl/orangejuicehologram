Hack'20 Project - Created by Arthur Liu, Daniel Zhu, and Jake Jung

COVID-19 has forced students like ourselves to adjust to an unprecedented online learning environment. The proximity and density of university classes is highly conducive to the spread of a deadly pandemic; virtual learning has already become, and will be, the norm for the foreseeable future. If the return of in-person instruction is nowhere in sight, our objective should then be to optimize our virtual learning experience as much as possible.

Our project transforms a video so that it can be reflected onto a [Pepper's Cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost), creating a lifelike three-dimensional display on top of your laptop/tablet screen. Our first Pepper's Cone was created from a used orange juice bottle - hence the namesake, orangejuicehologram.
